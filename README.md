# guess-the-number-computer-

This is just a small program in which the computer generates an random number between 1 and 10.
Next, the user has to enter his own number and try to guess what the computer number is.
Then, there is a while loop (but by giving the program all the conditions, this renders the loop pretty much useless - if I haven't had used the else statement, the loop would had been useful in this case).
And finally some conditionals that print different stuff for different scenarios.

P.S. If you guess the number, the computer might want to go on a date with you
