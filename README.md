# guess-the-number-computer-

This is just a small program in which the computer generates an random number between 1 and 10.
Next the user has to enter his own number and try to guess what the computer number is.
Then there is a while loop (but by giving the program all the conditions this loop is pretty much useless - if I haven't had use the else statement, the loop would had been useful)
And some conditionals that print different stuff.

P.S. If you guess the number, the computer might want to go on a date with you
